# StreamBenchmarkScala
This repository contains a set of stream processing applications taken from the literature written in Apache Spark, and from existing repositories (e.g., 
[here](https://github.com/ParaGroup/StreamBenchmarks)), 
which have been cleaned up properly. The applications can be run in a homogeneous manner and their execution collects statistics of throughput (bandwidth) and latency in different ways.
